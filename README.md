# **Overview**

TTS is a **Text-to-Speech** bot for Discord. It uses the **[gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)** library to generate audio files from text. The bot then plays the audio file in the voice channel so other people don't have to stop what they are doing to read what you wrote.

# **Features**

* Give your text a voice!
* Read your text aloud!
* Run on any platform!
* Easily self-hostable on any server (even on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com))!
* Easy to use!
* It's free!

# **Installation**

**The officially supported platforms are:**
* Windows
* Most Linux distributions

(It may work on MacOS, but I haven't tested it)

# **Choose how you want to host the bot**

You can choose to host the bot on your own server or on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for free.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/CoccodrillooXDS/TTS-bot/wiki) to see how to host the bot.
